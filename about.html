&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>we are the society of the catholice apostolate</h1>
 The Society of the Catholic Apostolate, officially abbreviated as <em>SAC</em>, is a Society of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right for men in the Roman Catholic Church. They are more commonly known as the Pallottines, named after their founder, Saint Vincent Pallotti.
Here are some key facts about our Society:
Founder: Saint Vincent Pallotti, a Roman Catholic priest, founded the Society in 1835 in Rome, Italy.
<b>Motto:</b> our motto is "Caritas Christi urget nos," which translates to "The love of Christ impels us."
<b>Mission:</b> Inspired by St. Vincent Pallotti, their mission is to revive faith and rekindle charity in all members of the faithful, recognizing that every baptized person is called to be an apostle. They aim to involve all Catholics, clergy, religious, and laity, in the Church's mission.
<b>Activities:</b> The Pallottines are involved in a wide range of ministries around the world, including: Administering parishes, schools, and missions. Running clinics, retreat houses, and various charitable works. Ministering to the poor, sick, marginalized, soldiers, workers, students, and prisoners. Founding orphanages and institutions of charity. Engaging in scientific research, such as the Institute for Catholic Church Statistics in Poland.
Global Presence: They are present in over 45 countries on six continents.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Union of Catholic Apostolate (UAC):</b> The Pallottines are part of the larger Union of Catholic Apostolate, which encompasses various communities (clergy, religious, and laity) who share St. Vincent Pallotti's vision of universal apostolate.
Promises: Members of the Society of the Catholic Apostolate bind themselves to the Society by promises of chastity, poverty, obedience, perseverance, the sharing of resources, and the spirit of service.
In essence, the Society of the Catholic Apostolate (Pallottines) is a vibrant and active religious community dedicated to spreading the Gospel and fostering collaboration among all members of the Church to fulfill its apostolic mission.</font> <br>
<h3>PALLIOTINES IN NIGERIA</h3>
The Pallottines, officially known as the Society of the Catholic Apostolate (SAC), have a significant and growing presence in Nigeria, encompassing both the Pallottine Fathers and Brothers and the Pallottine Missionary Sisters.
Pallottine Fathers and Brothers in Nigeria:
History: The Pallottine presence in Nigeria has an interesting history. It began with the influence of Monsignor Father Dr. Martin Chukwubunna Ezeokoli, who encountered the Pallottine Sisters during his studies in Rome. This led to the formation of "Pallotti Groups" among students in Oko, Nigeria, with the slogan "Pallotti for Action â€“ Action for Christ."
Establishment of a Mission: In 2007, Father Peter Hillen SAC arrived in Nigeria to explore possibilities for a mission station. He was instrumental in setting up the first postulancy house in Mbaukwu, Anambra State, which became a permanent site thanks to land donated by King Anukwu.
Growth and Development: The Pallottine Fathers in Nigeria have seen considerable growth. The first Nigerian Pallottine priest, Rev. Fr. John Ndidi Nwoacha SAC, was ordained in 2010.
Current Status: Nigeria is part of the German-Austrian Province of the Pallottines. As of 2022, there were approximately 25 brothers and postulants living and working in Mbaukwu, with another 25 brothers and novices in the formation house in Owerri North L.G.A. Many young Nigerian Pallottines also study abroad, particularly in Nairobi, Kenya.
Ministries: The Pallottine Fathers are involved in various ministries, including:
Formation: They have houses of formation for aspiring priests and brothers.
Pastoral Work: They serve in parishes.
Social Projects: They have initiated numerous social projects to improve living conditions for the poor and disadvantaged, such as providing teaching materials for schools, building youth centers, and establishing palm oil mills and water boreholes.
Retreat and Guest House: They have the Holy Trinity Retreat and Guest House in Mbaukwu.
Youth Apostolate: A significant focus is on youth apostolate, with plans for a large Pallottine and youth center in Mbaukwu. To know more about our province, click <a href="https://www.pallottiner.org/en/community/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>
