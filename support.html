We engage in so many works of charity; from building schools, to providing food and clothing for the poor, to building churches and hospitals. We also engage in youth apostolate, helping the youth to grow in faith and love of God. <br>
We organise monthly charity outreach programs to reach out to the less privileged in our society. Your support can make a difference!
